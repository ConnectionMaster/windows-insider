# Start flighting as a business
You can install Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds directly on your individual device or virtual machine. Or if you're an administrator, you can [manage them centrally across your organization](./manage-builds.md).


## Install on your individual device


### Preparation

First, make sure you're ready to set up flighting:

- To install Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds1, you must be running a licensed version of Windows 10 on your device. You can install Windows 10 here if your device is currently running an older version or if you need to buy Windows. If you're having issues installing Windows 10, you can also download a Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO to get started.

- The process of setting up flighting restarts your device during program setup and updating. Make sure you're ready for this, so you don't lose open documents or unsaved work. You might also want to take a picture of these directions or bookmark this page on your browser to get back to it easily.

- Make sure that we support your language.

3. Follow the directions on your screen to choose the experience and channel you'd like to get Insider Preview builds through. (Not sure which channel to choose? [Learn more about channels.](../flighting.md))

4. Review the Privacy Statement and program terms, confirm, and choose **Restart Now** or **Restart Later** to finish setting up your device.

## Install on a virtual machine

Running Insider Preview builds on a virtual machine is a great option if you don't want to change the version of Windows 10 actually running on your device.

1. [Set up a virtual machine on your device](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine) or get the [Windows 10 Preview from the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-hyperv.windows10preview?tab=Overview).

2. If you set up a VM on your device, [download the latest Insider Preview build](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced) and follow the directions on the [Windows Insider Preview downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced) to install it on your virtual machine. If you used the Windows 10 Preview from the Azure Marketplace, you'll see preview builds right away.
