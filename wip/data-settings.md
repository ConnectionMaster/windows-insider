# Choosing your data settings
Your privacy is important to us, so you're in control of how much of your data you share with us. But to run Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds, you must allow us to see a certain amount of diagnostic data, so we can investigate issues you might see, like crashes and bugs.

## Check or update your data settings

To run Insider Preview builds, you must have optional data turned on. Use these instructions to check or update your diagnostic data settings.

1. Go to [**Settings** > **Privacy** > **Diagnostics & feedback**](https://aka.ms/WIPDataSettings) on your device.

2. Check the **Optional Diagnostic Data** switch. If it's flipped to **On**, you're ready to go. If it's set to **Off**, flip it to **On** and reboot your device.

3. Go to [**Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Update**](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate) to check for the latest update.
